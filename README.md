# Note Taker

<h1>Note Taking</h1>
<p>The purpose of this application is to generate an application that allows developers to organize their thoughts by creating notes</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>Created functions and variables including file system and express allowing them to interact with the front end code</p>

<p>Made a get command that would grab the notes.html file and return the data to generate in a web page</p>

<p>Then I created a function that would allow the user to grab notes using a specific id using another get request</p>

<p>Created a get request to read the db.json file and return all of the saved notes as JSON files</p>

<p>Then I added a function that would allow me to delete notes using their specific id's</p>

<p>The I wrote a POST route to fetch the the route with api/notes in it</p>

<p>Lastly I wrote another get command to retrieve the index.html and return the data in the file to project onto a web page</p>
